## What is the sparksnake library?

The *sparksnake* library provides an easy, fast, and efficient way to use Spark features through analytics services on AWS. Through its features, it is possible to use classes, methods and functions developed in pyspark that aim to simplify, as much as possible, the journey of use of this framework through the particularities found in AWS services, such as Glue and EMR, for example.

> **Note**
